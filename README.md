YTList
======

This is a tool to list the youtube videos you need to watch in your subscription list.
Earlier Youtube supplied you with such a list but nowadays they have hidden this feature behind most favired and what other have watched.
So <a href="https://github.com/daviddeutsch">daviddeutsch</a> created a small javascript to list the videos in a grid.
I wanted an android app to list my videos so I set up this small project.
